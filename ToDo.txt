To do:

- Test send command to read Kyl_temp at 00102D.
  Successful!

- Verify command to read Kyl_temp at 00102D without sendning ack after, since it doesn't seem like it's needed.
  Verified!
- Test what command(s) reads the symbol table. Is it S first and then CR repeatedly, or S repeatedly?
  The answer is first S, then CR, then ACK repeatedly. Each ack makes T5 send one single character in the symbol table.
  In my binary there are 426 symbols. Each symbol has a character length of 8 plus the length of the name. If every symbol has a
  name length of 10 characters there would be (8+10)*426=7662 characters to read in the symbol table plus the delimiter which is
  first D and then A.
  It seems that the first 4 characters is the address. If T5 sends 1023, the address would be AL=0x10 AH=0x23.
  Then there are 4 characters that I don't know what they mean. 
  Then comes the symbol name.
  Then comes the delimiter which, as previously stated, is D and then A.
- Read symbol table and see what it looks like and how big it is.
  Answer is above.

- Figure out a way to extract the address to a specific symbol after reading the symbol table, or a small part of it. Done, T5CANReadSymTab now outputs adress, length and symbol name!
- Send a request to read that symbol.

- the symbol table request returns ascii characters in decimal, they should be saved and used as bytes in hex. so for example in adress 0x486C, 6 is recieved as 54 and C is recieved as 67. thus 54 => 6 and 67 => C. then 2 characters have to be put in 1 byte, so 6 and C will be 0x6C. Edit by Christian: Not needed. It dosen't matter if you display it as hex, dec or anything else. The Arduino knows how to use it anyway.
- make a list of symbols we want to use, symbol table is way to big so we only save addresses of symbols we use. 	see Symbols we use.xlsx Edit by Christian: I've made the symbol reader so simple that changing what symbols you want to use is as simple as typing the name of the symbol.
- the second 4 characters, at least the last two of it, are for length. the length probably mean data length?
- determin the amount of symbols is T5. Edit by Christian: The symbol reader counts the number of symbols, even though it is not important for us to know.
- determin the maximum length of a symbol name. Edit by Christian: Not needed. I've made the buffer 32 characters long. Should this not be sufficent, just change the array length of symbolBuf and symbolCompare.
- make a list of advanced features we could make. 	see advanced features list.txt
- design the program structure and flow, before we start coding like crazy. Edit by Christian: Too late. I'm coding like crazy every minute I can =)
