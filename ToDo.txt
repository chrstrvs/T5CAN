- Test send command to read Kyl_temp at 00102D.
  Successful!

- Verify command to read Kyl_temp at 00102D without sendning ack after, since it doesn't seem like it's needed.
  Verified!
- Test what command(s) reads the symbol table. Is it S first and then CR repeatedly, or S repeatedly?
  The answer is first S, then CR, then ACK repeatedly. Each ack makes T5 send one single character in the symbol table.
  In my binary there are 426 symbols. Each symbol has a character length of 8 plus the length of the name. If every symbol has a
  name length of 10 characters there would be (8+10)*426=7662 characters to read in the symbol table plus the delimiter which is
  first D and then A.
- Read symbol table and see what it looks like and how big it is.
  Answer is above.
